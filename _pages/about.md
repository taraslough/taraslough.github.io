I am an Associate Professor in the Wilf Family Department of Politics at New York University. 

I write on the political economy of institutions and development. My current research focuses on the comparative study of bureaucracies and on research design. My work appears or is forthcoming in journals including the <em>American Journal of Political Science</em>, the <em>American Political Science Review</em>, the <em>Journal of Politics</em>, <em>Science</em>, and the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>, among others. My research has been supported by grants from the NSF, USAID, EGAP/DFID, J-PAL, and Innovations for Poverty Action.

I recently earned my PhD from Columbia University. In my final two years of graduate school, I was a predoctoral fellow at Evidence in Governance and Politics (EGAP) at the University of California, Berkeley. Before graduate school, I was a professional violinist. I earned both a BM in Violin Performance and a BA in Political Science from Rice University.
